Whoooooa, sing sing 
Yea you got a lot of chickes
And they got a lot of wishes 
They be fiending for the riches 
They aint gotta give them up 

Whoooooa, sing sing 
Yea you got a lot of chickes
And they got a lot of wishes 
They be fiending for the riches 
They aint gotta give them up 

My garden's white as daisies 
And it's untouched and complete 
Checking my rhythm baby 
My sky's been a looking great 
My garden's white as daisies 
And it's untouched of sin 
My roots been craving lately 
To soak in your diamonds 

Dig it 
You want it 
And I want you laying on me 
My flower bed's calling your name, your name, your name 
I'll let your rain fall down if it sparkles like diamonds 
Just let me wear the crown, my garden's appetizing 
I'll let your rain fall down if it sparkles like diamonds 
Just let me wear the crown, my garden's appetizing 

Whoooooa, sing

Yea you got a lot of chickes
And they got a lot of wishes 
They be fiending for the riches 
They aint gotta give them up 

I'm singing 
Whoooooa, hey

Yea you got a lot of chickes
And they got a lot of wishes 
They be fiending for the riches 
They aint gotta give them up 

My garden's white as daisies 
And it's untouched and complete 
Checking my rhythm baby 
My sky's been a looking great 
My garden's white as daisies 
And it's untouched of sin 
My roots been craving lately 
To soak in your diamonds 

Dig it 
You want it 
And I want you laying on me 
My flower bed's calling your name, your name, your name 
I'll let your rain fall down if it sparkles like diamonds 
Just let me wear the crown, my garden's appetizing 
I'll let your rain fall down if it sparkles like diamonds 
Just let me wear the crown crown crown crown
